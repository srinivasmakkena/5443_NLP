I bought this phone a little doubtful If it would be in good condition. I ordered it in good condition and bit excellent and with the price I was a little scared. Bit to say the least this thing is spotless. The screen has zero scratches I mean zero. The only sign of wear is the scratches around the charging port and the micro scratches around the body of the phone. If I showed this to somebody and asked then if they think I bought it new or used they would say new. Everything works perfectly and this phone was in pristine condition. It was by far the cheapest option and it really came through. I highly recommend this phone if you are on a budget but want a high end phone. I'm extremely satisfied with the final product and I will be recommending this to friends and family.,"Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2024",5.0 out of 5 stars,Collin
"The media could not be loaded.If no FURTHER edits are posted after this review, then everything's working as it should again!] : After posting this review, I'm STILL satisfied with the PHONE itself! Don't get me wrong, this thing is BADASS for the price I got it for! Still awesome!The only thing I found, and you can see for yourself in the video that I posted above where I write ""Pen Works Great"" was, that I'd constantly receive this message, saying that my phone wouldn't connect to the S PEN that the phone came with, in conjunction with denying me of the (Air Actions) features that the phone comes programmed with?So I just simply bought a brand new (""Samsung"" branded) S Pen, and NOW the phone and ALL of its features works %100 as it should! I'm assuming the S Pen that came with the phone was an aftermarket pen or something. So in conclusion, if you run into the same issue, just buy a new S Pen from ""Samsung"" themselves! It fixed the issue for me!Shipping:Phone arrived immediately on the next business day (Monday), 3 days after ordering it (Friday).In the box:-Phone-Fast Adaptive Charger Base-Fast Charging CableUnboxing/ Initial Impression:Outstanding condition of the phone itself! Not a single scratch, not a single fingerprint (other than my own fingerprints after unwrapping it). The box came well-packaged, and inside of an envelope.SIM Installation:Now, I DO have to say..-I read another reviewers comment, saying that BEFORE installing the SIM card, one should UPDATE THE PHONE'S SOFTWARE until it no longer needs to update. Which I did. So, after it updated to December's latest software.. I installed the SIM card. Works flawlessly. Sent and received phone calls/ texts/ etc.S Pen:Pen works great!Final words:If you're thinking about it... DON'T THINK ABOUT IT. Get the phone! Highly recommend selecting the ""excellent condition"" option. I've just upgraded from the Samsung Galaxy S10 to this Galaxy S22 Ultra, and WOW have I been missing out on this technology.. Time will always tell, so look out for any edits, but so far so good!","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2023",5.0 out of 5 stars,ADQ
"Ordered a Refurbed S22 Ultra. Got the device. Set up the device. Thought things were fine. Until the first time I left the house.The device works fine as long as I'm connected to WiFi and have WiFi calling enabled. I can call, text, MMS, whatever. But ONLY if I'm connected to WiFi and have WiFi calling enabled.As soon as I disconnect WiFi calling, I lose EVERYTHING. No voice. No data. No MMS. No nothing.I've tried with TWO different mobile providers using both physical and eSIMs in the device.Same result with each.This appears to be a known issue with this device based on the literal hundreds of similar posts on Reddit and other online forums.I've tried reaching out via formal channels on Amazon help and support, but the only response I've been given was a question about which mobile provider I'm using. This shouldn't matter since the phone is marked as ""Unlocked"".I've reached out now, a second time, to Amazon help in hopes that the seller will communicate with me, but I'm not hopeful at this point. I'm understanding why WirelessGlobe only has an 80% positive in the last 12 months.If I'm wrong and they fix this situation quickly and ammicably, I'll happily update my review, but my first impressions with them are not great.Again, if I'm wrong and they fix this appropriately, this review will be replaced with an updated review, but I want people to know that they are VERY slow to handle these situations and it's frustrating.","Reviewed in the United States on January 30, 2024",1.0 out of 5 stars,David B
"The first phone I received had a generic replacement screen. In the first picture you can see how the screen has a huge black bezel, compared to the next one with the correct screen. The screen was also blurry compared to the correct screen. Also the battery seemed to go down faster than normal. However, the company responded promptly and replaced it. The next phone has minimal signs of wear and functions properly with the correct screen. Overall happy with my purchase now.","Reviewed in the United States on January 15, 2024",4.0 out of 5 stars,Harrell's

"It's almost perfect on the outside there's just a small scratch near one of the camera lens and there's dust particles all around the lens which I can deal with my only problem is that the charger that came with it said its gonna take 5hrs to charge the phone now I had a fast charger I plugged it in and it said 1hr and 23 mins which is normal for a fast charger, however, the phone took over 20 mins to get 2% charge on it so if this continues I'm definitely returning it","Reviewed in the United States on January 30, 2024",3.0 out of 5 stars,Sanay

"I'll start off by saying the exterior was immaculate, I was impressed with that. What disappointed me was that the charger that came with it charged 1% at a time for every 30mins. Also there was something loose,jiggling around in there. It would make calls but when someone tried to call my phone it would go straight to voice-mail. I previously owned a galaxy s22 ultra (loved it,reason for a second purchase)but I did drop it an that's what ruined something inside an wouldn't let me receive calls. I had this one for less than 24hrs and I did not drop it but it was doing the same thing. I did reach out to get a refund,which I received super fast. I may try again another time with this seller.","Reviewed in the United States on December 16, 2023",3.0 out of 5 stars,Cynthia Miranda

"Upon opening, Very happy, the phone is in excellent condition like promised. It came with a full charger set, and a tool to open the sim card slot. It was unlocked like promised, even though when u start up my phone says Verizon it was still unlocked, I can't help but wonder if the ppl who claimed theirs weren't (in the review comments) unlocked if they they just assumed it wasn't bc of the provider's name that flashes when u start up the device...either way mine was unlocked and I was able to transfer my tracfone number to my new phone, i just had to buy a BYOD sim card to do it. The only thing I would have liked even more is if they could have provided instructions for the phone, (example: ""this button does that), like how a brand new phone come with instructions and ""how to"" features, but minus that tiny complaint which really doesn't matter because you can look it up, very happy i got exactly what i wanted and it was at a way better cost than others!","Reviewed in the United States on August 31, 2022",4.0 out of 5 stars,maria
"The phone that arrived had so many scratches seemed to not have any scratches. I wanted a phone for my personal use only. After researching I decided to try Samsung, Galaxy Ultra 22. When it arrived I took it to my phone carrier to get it activated; unfortunately, the phone couldn‚Äôt be work bc it wouldn‚Äôt accept esim. We tried the actual sim to see if it will work and it didn‚Äôt work. We put the new sim in another phone to make sure the issue is not the sim and sure the he sim was working fine.

"I bought the black, unlocked, refurbished, good condition, 128GB one. It came a day before than expected. It's actually unlocked, nothing about Verizon here for me, there's no cracked screen. Minor blemishes on the side but they're unnoticeable and you can cover it with a phone case so it's not a big deal. Works pretty fast and easily.

"I ordered an unlocked phone from someone else and it didn't work with my Sim from mint mobile.  That was probably due to my lack of understanding compatibility.  And it was hooked up to Verizon at one point,  with remnants of Verizon software.Returned it and found this one.  Excellent condition.  Easy setup.  Fast shipping.  Flawless.  Thank you so much!","Reviewed in the United States on September 29, 2023",5.0 out of 5 stars,Kelly M.
"I could not have asked for a better deal. This phone was fully unlocked, works with almost every provider out there, and it was dang near half off a brand new one. It came with a few dings in the sides, but they were extremely shallow and hard to notice. The screen was flawless, the camera is beautiful the pen works amazingly, everything is working exactly as it should. I was hesitant, but I'm so glad I bought this phone for myself. If I could afford one for all of my friends I would get them all one. The fingerprint reader works great(although all of these phones might have issues when you get a screen protector), the colors are vibrant, microphone is epic, the speakers work well, the battery holds all day. That said, this model does nor come with a headphone jack, but who doesn't have a pair of Bluetooth headphones at this point? I don't use the face scanner because it is not as secure as fingerprints. I could go on and on, but if you're considering it and you can afford the money(I saved up and bought mine outright so I own it), I highly recommend this!","Reviewed in the United States on November 9, 2022",5.0 out of 5 stars,Forever Sus

"Bought a refurbished in ""good condition"" s22 ultra and besides the scratches on the bottom of the charging port and on top, its pretty much in decent shape.

"As the headline states, the phone arrived in great physical condition and seems to be working fine up to this point. However, upon starting up the device, it was locked to Verizon and i have T-Mobile so the phone was not working with my sim card. I called Verizon and after about 15 minutes of back and forth and some questions, they were able to unlock the phone for me. Be weary about receiving a locked phone from this seller. If the roles were reversed, and I had Verizon and the phone was locked to, lets just say ATT, the phone would have bloatware that could not be removed and the process would be much more difficult, if even possible. Overall, I'm happy with the purchase and the price point provided","Reviewed in the United States on September 1, 2022",4.0 out of 5 stars,jon
"In our case the refurbished S22 Ultra was absolutely flawless.Some people are disturbed that when they turn on the phone the first screen says ""Verizon"". This doesn't mean the phone isn't unlocked.You need to follow these instructions when you get the phone.BEFORE YOU PUT YOUR SIM CARD INTO THE PHONE DO THE FOLLOWING:1) Connect the phone to your Wifi Network.2) Settings -> Search for ""Software Update"" and update the Android Operating System3) Repeat Step #2 above till the latest version of Android is installed.4) Insert your SIM Card. In our case we inserted a T-Mobile SIM Card5) When asked if you want to switch the phone to your mobile carries say yes.In our case accepting at Step#5 caused our phone's start screen to say T-Mobile, and T-Mobile's built-in apps replaced the Verizon Apps previously on our phone.","Reviewed in the United States on January 1, 2023",5.0 out of 5 stars,JBW2000
Samsung while being a company of many products still continues to make the flagship of flagships for Android. The Note 22 ( you read that right) is a great phone for performance and pictures.

"I received two phones that both had a glitch in that there was a log in on the home page requiring a password?No one from Greentech, a repair shop or any of my tech friends knew what it was for or what to do about it.I tried every log in I had for Google, WiFi, my old phone and several others with no luck.Greentech had never hear of it, even though I got two phones in a row that had this issue.Most everyone thought it must have been the password of the previous owner and it could not be erased from the phone.Fortunately I was able to do a search and sure enough it was not a common issue, but had been one on Samsung phones.What was required was a factory reset.The problem for some is that this erases all the data from your phone.In my case, I was transferring data from my old phone to this S22 Ultra., so it didn't matter.The transfer of data was done and everything works fine.But I'm definitely keeping my old phone in case this ever happens again!","Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2023",1.0 out of 5 stars,J.

Basically didn't know and recommend buying from a different seller, causing me a lot of headaches now because I didn't know how to verify they sold me a product with unlocked firmware.","Reviewed in the United States on April 30, 2023",1.0 out of 5 stars,Newt Tiner

"Can't use any of the above because phone arrived locked even though it was advertised as unlocked. Would have loved to be able to use it. Need a new phone or wouldn't have purchased in the first place. This is listed as an official Amazon refurbished product, yet Amazon did nothing to to solve our issue. Attitude was ""take it or leave it."" Obviously only thing company is concerned about these days is profits.","Reviewed in the United States on September 1, 2022",1.0 out of 5 stars,Terry C.

Phone wasn't unlocked. Am not happy at all. At least Amazon should hold sellers accountable for lying to buyers. The phone is a Verizon phone and can't be unlocked by buyer. Am so disappointed.,"Reviewed in the United States on September 2, 2022",1.0 out of 5 stars,sharifatu Strong

Phone says:  there is moisture in the USB port.  Impossible.  Phone never leaves the house.  A fellow USAF Veteran with 26 years of service3 said - there is a design flaw in the phone and cannot charge it using a cable.  Buy a wireless charger - works fine.  I have all Apple products; 9 or 10.  Last time I buy anything made by Samsung.,"Reviewed in the United States on February 7, 2023",3.0 out of 5 stars,Happy Cooker
