Adrian,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 15, 2024",Positive,"{'Negative': 0.007851655, 'Neutral': 0.036359496, 'Positive': 0.95578885}","PLEEEEEASE people, stop complaining about the display and things like that, the display is just AMAZING!!By looking at the low rating of the item, I was really impatient to recieve my device and finally write the review about it. I pre-ordered the S24 Ultra in Violet color, 512Gb version, and want to note that everything was fair as expected - I got the 512Gb version at the price of 256Gb one, and also 200$ Amazon Gift, which is a non-redeemable gift that works as a single time -200$ to your purchases FROM AMAZON, that you can use within approximately 5 or 6 months.Next about the device - it's really beautiful! I really love everything about it, the size, the flat screen, the back cover and cameras - design-wise this is a beauty.It has lot's of nice and fun features to play with, it's my second day of usage and I still have AI features to test, camera capabilities to check out, etc. And the S Pen - this is my first ever Samsung phone, and I really got used to it, and to be honest - it's sometimes a lot more comfortable to use the S Pen instead of your fingers. Some things in life are really designed to be accomplished with a pen and paper, this phone covers that need!The sound and speakers are veeery loud, I mean my whole office can hear my incoming notifications lol, and the quality of music listening, video watching, etc. - really nice.I still have to find out all of the capabilities of the camera, this is a separate big topic, but so far I can confirm what lot's of reviewers have already talked about - the normal photo taking is great, selfies look really amazing for a front camera, the zoom is fantastic with really good details, night mode results in bright as day photos (although a bit noisy) and video shooting is also nice with different mods.The OS is very nice and really sophisticated to say the least, I mean you can connect the device to a monitor, mouse and keyboard via some 5-in-1 Anker for example, and here you just got yourself a laptop with the size of a phone. OneUI is really the most rich software I've used so far, and before using it I was skeptical if I'd like it or not, but I'm really getting used to it, and the features like multitasking in a true desktop way on the phone - this is something else (not the Dex, just phone multi window usage, that's AWESOME).The battery is nice, maybe I expected something more by viewing some reviews with almost 20 hours of screen time or so, but really it's fine for a day of usage with QHD resolution, adaptive brightness, and app and AI usage during the whole day.The only disadvantages I want to mention are the price tag that is high (let's be honest) and the box contents, I mean why copy bad stuff from Apple and not include at least a small charging brick in the box? This is really uncool, especially within that price.I started with the display, but want to finish talking about it as well, it's HUGE, and I really like it, the corners are sharp-ended, but that gives you the advantage of viewing a non-cropped-out content, the resolution, the brightness, refresh rate... The display is a killer really, I really don't get the people that complain about the color, or perform some tests on the device, etc.... no need.Overall I'm really happy with my purchase, this is a great phone I can recommend to any software and hardware enthusiasts like me, and maybe to iPhone users as well, to come out of the box and see that there are other great phones out there in the world that can totally kill any iPhone with all the features and stuff you get."
Marc,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 8, 2024",Negative,"{'Negative': 0.7784287, 'Neutral': 0.1925503, 'Positive': 0.029021047}","I've been using my Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra for a couple of days now and while it's a decent phone, it has its issues. The screen is washed out like they say, but that might be resolved in an OS update. Mine has a grainy screen like the rest of Galaxy S24 Ultra owners have been complaining about, so that's one reason to wait before preordering the next Galaxy smartphone. I didn't see the banding issue and I don't believe I have the camera issue, but I haven't played much with the camera to tell. If you're upgrading from the S23U, might be best to keep it and wait another year.Besides the phone itself, I've been super frustrated from my experience preordering from Amazon.The preorder page had a deal where you'd get the 512GB storage upgrade + $200 Amazon gift card sent via email after the phone was delivered. I got the storage upgrade, but I never received the $200 Amazon gift card they promised. Why I think this is a scam is that Amazon switched the preorder deal with the launch deal on the Amazon order page, so now when you ask Amazon Support about it, they can't help because the info is no longer on the Amazon site. Getting to this conclusion was a waste of time because I've spent hours talking to multiple Amazon employees (all useless & with different answers) and never received a reply from the email I received from their Care team showing proof of the many popular news outlets advertising the pre order deal (Google CNET, Phone Arena, ZDNET, The Verge, CBS News, Digital Trends, etc and you can find them talking about the preorder deal on Amazon for the phone).So yea, don't preorder because Amazon doesn't honor their end on deals and you might get a faulty phone that's not covered in influencer reviews (wait for the real reviews from real customers)"

Haven't played around with its AI features yet. Photography is superb! The screen colors are a bit dull, but that's a moot point since a fix will be released soon.My only gripe is with Amazon. I never received the $ 200 promotional credit advertised for pre-ordering the phone on its site. Chat support associates are clueless, stating such an offer never existed, while e-mails to customer service go unanswered. Really disappointed"

I tend to keep my phones for about 5 years so it has to be a great one.I wasn't disappointed. Long battery. Good cameras. The front face camera is only OK. But the sound is awesome. Nice and loud. I haven't used ear buds with it yet so that's to be determined. The color of the phone it matte.The $200 credit was applied immediately. I can't see a balance on my account, but if you go to purchase something shipped by Amazon and also sold by Amazon, checkout and you will see the your credit on your total. I used the payment plan option and still received my credit after shipment.If something goes wrong with the s24 ultra, I will update:)"

It's everyone.  The world's current most expensive flagship phone actually shipped with a glitched out, awful looking  bland washed out screen that is cringe inducing when looking at it.  If you're expecting the beauty of the previous S2X phone series, you won't get it here, this screen is BAD and shipped effectively broken and not working properly to every single customer.  Honestly, everyone should be refunded and if there's a class action lawsuit, I'm definitely joining it.  All of the colors look completely washed out and almost pastel, it's just . . . BAD!  It reminds me of installing a wrong video driver in the 90's or if you're using an unsupported color/resolution mode.  Aside from the color just being horrendous and completely inaccurate, text looks smoothed and slightly blurry making it off-putting to read.  Looking at the S24 Ultra beside of the S22 Ultra is like night and day, no way in the world would I recommend someone to buy a S24 over the S22 or S23.  The S24 looks like garbage.  How in the world did they justify shipping it like this?  How in the world are they getting away with this?!  Massive respect and faith has been lost in Samsung as a smartphone leader in my eyes due to this.  Also, it's extremely suspicious that NO tech reviewers mentioned this, as if they were told not to or something.  I smell a lawsuit on the horizon . . .Shame on Samsung, big time . . .  I've been a loyal customer since the Galaxy III, but I think that this debacle has ended that long run that I was very happy about.  I feel betrayed and duped.DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE."

They are very muted. They look almost as good as a phone I purchased almost 7 years ago. The resolution is great, but the colors, just don't seem right. Other than that I can't find anything to complain about.  I hope this is just a software issue that just needs an update or I will feel a bit ripped off for the price."

(This is a universally known issue at this point)The screen colors are extremely cool/blueReception is middling (still a big issue as of 2/14/24)Camera white balance is straight green/blueWide angle camera is not as wide as my Note 20 and no better qualityWhen on speakerphone, the top speaker cuts out if you put it up to your ear.Generally jagged user experience due to a bunch of Samsung crap that cannot be removed.Bloody expensive for something that's delivered in this state.The meh:Batt life is good (not great, just good) only if run in 60hz and low power mode.In low power mode at 120hz the batt life is merely acceptable.All compared to my 3ye old note 20 in low power 60hz mode which is just below acceptable.The good:The antireflective coating on the screen is genuinely amazingThe 120hz on the screen is uber smooth but unfortunately hits the battThe rest is fine; not different from my Note 20There's a thread on the Samsung forum that's thousands of posts long about these same issues I've brought up here.Hopefully all of the bad can be fixed with a software update but currently the phone is  borderline unusable due to the extremely blue camera(s) white balance and lacking signal strength. I cannot understand how after ALL THIS TIME, Samsung seemingly doesn't test their flagship phone before manufacturing and shipping.As for the cameras, they're okay if the white balance wasn't green/blue. My Note 20 from 3yrs ago takes nicer looking pictures but it's honestly difficult to tell if the cameras are any good because it's just so green/blue.I don't know what to say about all the tech reviewers out there raving about this phone. Either they were given a completely different phone or they're all paid off. I wouldn't recommend this phone to anyone until Samsung addresses the ridiculous issues.I absolutely hate Apple due to their requirement for you to live in their ecosystem but this will likely be my last Android if Samsung or someone else can't get their act together on such an expensive product.On a very very positive note, the antireflective screen on this phone is genuinely incredible. It's the single biggest upgrade imaginable. Unfortunately putting any screen protector ruins that feature so I'm just going to use it without a screen protector. The phone is worth buying simply for the antireflection. It's THAT BIG of a difference. I cannot understand why this isn't getting more attention. The darn signal strength issue is the single biggest deal breaker and so unfortunate and annoying. It's about ~20% worse than my 3yr old Note 20."

I'm personally not interested in all the cameras or stylus.However I'm not impressed with the 6.2 size and the iPhone-ish block looks of the body.Ironically I feel like this phone has less features than the One Plus Nord that has thumb unlock on the power button and so many UI choices not to mention the larger screen size for half the price!I also wasn't to impressed with the Samsung bloatware that can't be uninstalled unlike other unlocked phones.Over all it's an okay phone if you want something powerful and small.I just wish Samsung offered a larger sized phone without all the cameras and what not that someone like me that doesn't want or need.

El unico problema que tiene el celular son las camaras, no estan optimizadas ya que al procesar cualquier imagen con la camara de 50 megapixeles salen las imagen con mucha luz y se sienten algo quemadas. Lo que me dejo feliz fue la calidad de video ya que esta muy estabilizado y salen con buena calidad."

It's very hard to differentiate from an iPhone until you turn it on. Maybe that's the point.Good:Fingerprint scanner is VERY fast compared to my older s10. S10 is 5 years older so that isn't saying much.Lame:No more rounded edges or screen. SD card was great to be able to add more space when you download movies from apps.  No Headphone port, which has come in handy on OLD devices that only support aux inputs.The AI features are neat, but not all that useful. Maybe if you need to translate languages often. I'm not sure why the AI stuff can't be applied to any other phone, since a lot of it is offloaded to the cloud anyway.Seems to be an S23 with some software that could also work on the s23.

I mean this phone rocks in every way and the transition from my old s10 5g was seamless and straightforward. It literally took couple of hours from start to finish and there is no learning curve.

Seems like android or samsungs being too aggressive in making apps sleep in order to increase the Batter Life statistics for reviewers or something.

I only get notification pop-ups after I unlock the phone.... which is almost useless.---finally the human race has come to the conclusion that curved edge displays are absolutely not it.  thank you. thank you. thank you.

However, the sound quality is very disappointing.  Even at full volume, music playing from this phone is not nearly as loud as my old phone.  I see from the Samsung website that others have the same complaint.  I've shared this with Samsung.  Hopefully it's something that can be addressed with a software patch and not a hardware issue.  If anything changes in this regard, I'll update my review.Update: got an unhelpful response from Samsung yesterday.  Today, I tried listening to music through earbuds instead of using the phone speakers.  The left channel is almost completely muted.  I checked the equalizer and it's set for even distribution between left and right channels.  I've let Samsung know about this.  We'll see what happens.Update 2: Samsung tells me they've raised the issue w/their developers for further evaluation.  Meanwhile, I've noticed a second issue.  The screen flickers when I scroll with my finger.  This happens with all the applications on my phone. I've reported this to Samsung as well.Update 3: I've discovered the problem with the left channel.  The problem wasn't in the Equalizer.  In Settings > Accessibility > Hearing enhancements, the balance was incorrect.  I've corrected that, and now the sound is great with my earbuds. However, the loudness and sound quality through the phone speakers still are inferior to my S10e."

If Samsung does not fix this egregious issue, I will have no choice but to return in.

The S24 Ultra is a behemoth in every sense of that word - features and weight.  My advice is to get it IF you have a reason to have the features unique to it.  Otherwise, there are lighter weight and smaller phones that are more comfortable to use daily -- and I say that as a male who is over 6'5"", with hands that match my height. The Samsung S24 Plus comes to mind.I am keeping the S24 UItra because of my interest in photography (this phone has a macro feature, AF on its ultrawide lens, and greater telephoto abilities than the S24 Plus) and my use of the S Pen.  Photos are excellent, including at 5x zoom.  The screen brightness, resolution and anti-glare features are great.  The S Pen allows me to make precise choices on the screen for a variety of uses.  The battery easily lasts all day with moderate use.My only big knock is the weight of the phone.  Just too much.  Smaller issue -the sharp edges, but I am no longer really noticing it after two weeks."

The colors do seem a bit washed out on this screen vs the S23 ultra, but Samsung is saying there will be a fix for this.The only disappointment, and the reason why I won't keep that phone, are the cameras.The selfie camera is a disappointment both indoor and, surprisingly, even outdoor it was not good.I had a family event and was too excited to use that big Main camera for all the shots, but I was left disappointed with the performance compared to the iPhone. The low light pictures were not good at all, while pictures with enough light were good, but nothing special. I can't even start to compare this camera to the Google Pixel lines, not even close!Bottom line, you'll get a great daily performance with a good camera and beautiful screen, but I would wait until the price goes down a bit."

The Galaxy S24 Plus is another great smartphone from Samsung, and this time around, it makes a lot more sense.If you’re in the market for a big Samsung phone, the S24 Plus would be my personal recommendation over the S24 Ultra. The hardware is top-tier, the screen is almost every bit as good, the performance is great, the battery life is outstanding, and — if you care about them — you get all of the same Galaxy AI features. The only differences between the S24 Plus and the S24 Ultra are the improved camera system and the S Pen. But is that really worth an extra $300? I certainly don’t think so. The Galaxy S24 Ultra is a fantastic smartphone and one of the best you can buy in 2024. But it’s also $1,300.  There’s also the OnePlus 12 to consider, which delivers similarly great performance and battery life for $800. It’s a great package, but you also have to deal with a curved screen, a lower IP rating, no AI tricks, and fewer software updates. The regular Galaxy S24 shares many of the S24 Plus’ great qualities for the same $800 price, but you’ll need to put up with a smaller screen, lesser battery life, and slower charging.You have a lot of options to consider against the Galaxy S24 Plus, as is the case when you’re looking to buy any smartphone. But each alternative to the S24 Plus also has its own share of compromises. If the Galaxy S24 Plus’ strong suits line up with what you prioritize in a phone — hardware, display, performance, and battery life — I can’t recommend it enough."

The gold color looks amazing,  it looks like real gold. As far as battery life it meets and exceeds my expectations I can go all day and about the time I go to bed usually around 9 pm I can still have a 40 percent of battery life remaining.The screen looks brighter on sunny days with is an improvement compared to my s21 ultra 5G.The speakers sound awesome,  very clear and loud.The antenna or antennas on the s24 ultra we're also improved,  I can get a better reception and better download speeds, the phone transitions very smooth between 5g and 4g lte when 5 g is not strong enough or when there is no 5g connectivity.Let's not forget about the s pen, it is a multifunction pen, to be used to take pictures with it and by the way they look beautiful with some improvements on the camera. The s pen has a few other features that can be used to do a power point presentation and a few more things we can do with the s pen.I do understand that for 1400 dollars phone it should come with a complete charger and not just the charging cable.I do suspect that Samsung along with other manufacturers were limited to reduce the plastic usage and that could be the reason they did not include a brick charger. Assuming that previous galaxy fans would already have a brick charger.But I would of like to get a brick along with tye cable for that price. Unfortunately that was not the case.Luckily if you pre order your phone you could of got some goodies from Samsung like brick charger or cases or galaxy buds for free and or some smart watches/ galaxy buds/ tablet with a 150 dolar discount (credit)"

I'm not sure and can't speak for all the negative reviews on this phone with the washed out screen because mine is bright and beautiful like all my Samsung phones have always been. The battery is incredible. I can get a day and a half of heavy use and 2 days light to moderate without turning on battery saver but of course there are task that IMO are a battery killer like Android Auto when I'm navigating and streaming music at the same time but that's going would be the case with any battery because Android auto runs a lot of apps in the background. This phone is ridiculously fast, never had a phone quite this fast even my S23 Ultra wasn't this fast. My only complaint because I didn't pre order and spent over 1500 dollars after tax and that's just crazy when you think about what that can get you with an actual computer that isn't out dated the moment you purchase. But yeah still I am very pleased with my new beast even though only had it for a couple of weeks so far. If you have the funds and your not like me and buy 6 phones a year I think you'll get more than your moneys worth cause Samsung's just last and last for many years. My wife had her S9+ for over 5 years and the one before that for 4 years and everything worked fine on them. Highly recommend this phone."

I bought the s24 ultra and the screen is super grainy Samsung refuses to do anything about it and it just straight up looks like crap. The screen is so dull and ugly looking nothing like older Samsungs in any way. It feels like a cheap $300 or less phone probably worse. And the camera is one of the worst I’ve seen from Samsung pictures are over processed and blurry and just straight up looks terrible. I don’t usually write reviews but after this experience, I have to prevent other people from falling into the same trap. If you have an older Samsung, just keep that you’ll be much better off and have a much better phone with a bunch of money in your pocket. This so-called flagship phone is nothing but a cheaply made phone with no quality control with a company that doesn’t stand behind anything they make all they’re worried about is their pockets."

IMO, the S7 was the best camera for getting everything in focus with sharp details and excellent color fidelity and 4K videos are terrific. The S8 suffered from some weird video wobbles. The Note 4 was good in general, but the S7 really took the performance crown. Then came the S20U. Gorgeous display and had a SD Card slot. However, the camera was absolute and still is terrible. Can't focus on anything properly and wide shots were all bent at the edges.S24U Review starts now (I got mine early from t-mobile with build ending in: AWM9)Pros1. Flat Screen is absolutely perfect, no more rounded dust collecting edges and easier to apply tempered glass.2. Camera is superior compared to the S20U (well, any camera is...) and trades blows with the S7 and S8 and the macro camera on S24 helps with getting everything in focus and not just having the horrible higher DOF where most things are blurred out, so basically, you don't have to dance around to get everything in focus.3. It's fast.4. Still allows a nano sim card.5. Modes, I love this app, allows you to customize profiles for the phone based on your criteria and set it to run at a given time, like setting wallpaper, wifi on or off, screen color and blue light filter and so much more.Cons:1. Super AMOLED screen has been crippled to 85% DCI-P3. Looks like a cheap LCD screen. Vivid/Natural modes do nothing. Blue light filter makes it worse. Whites look bluish. It's like having a Ferrari and the manufacturer puts on governor on it because it goes to fast. It's a super amoled screen, give users the option of washed out, natural, vivid and ultra vivid, not just washed out.Don't take my word for it, go to your local carrier store and bring in your current Galaxy phone or just compare it to other phones in the store, it's that bad. If you have the S23U, it's not really an upgrade, it's more like a refresh that offers a flat display, but almost everything else is the same except for the washed out display and 10x optical dropped to 5x optical but with a higher resolution sensor.2. Camera doesn't take accurate colors, auto white balance doesn't work properly on macro shots.2. No charger (only a charging cable.)3. No SD Card slot.Notes:1. Forget about AI, between privacy and the fact they will be charging you for it at the end 2025, it's not worth. They are basically trying to get you hooked on it for a couple of years and then starting charging you for it once you rely on it. According to the Samsung product page: ""Galaxy AI features by Samsung will be provided for free until the end of 2025 on supported Samsung Galaxy devices.""2. 7 years of updates. Does that mean they allow you to change the battery during year 3 or 4? Of course not, and there's no battery service they offered either to make it last that long. It's a gimmick. Just like 10 year warranties on washing machines for the motor only, while everything breaks down before 10 years.3. I can't say if there's any detriment with the new AR glass, because the color saturation is so poor. If that's fixed, I'll update this review appropriately.4. I find my S20U gets brighter then the claimed max 2600 nits of this phone.Bottom line, I'm returning mine if Samsung doesn't fix the washed out display and the color issue on the camera. If they can fix that, it's a great phone, just don't get hooked on the AI unless you're willing to pay for it in the future.""The Dynamic AMOLED 2X display on Galaxy S24 Ultra received a certification from VDE Germany for 100 percent Mobile Color Volume in the DCI-P3 color range, which means your images aren’t washed out and you’ll get unbelievably vivid colors regardless of differing levels of brightness. The display can achieve peak brightness of up to 2600 nits, improving the contrast between dark and light aspects of digital content for a more brilliant picture quality, with a 5,000,000:1 contrast ratio to make your mobile experience more immersive.
