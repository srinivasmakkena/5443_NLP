It's impressiveSwapped from the s22 ultra and this is definitely worth itEs mi primer día usando el teléfono pero ya me a encantadoExcelenteGood phone.Never dropped it, no damage.Haven't use Samsung s series for a while can't believe it come with no charger and as hot as s9The media could not be loaded.Compre el artículo en pre orden y decia que si comproba me daría el doble de almacenamiento pero es mentira.Fue solo para que compráramos.amazon has not provided the promotional credit.Smaller issue -the sharp edges, but I am no longer really noticing it after two weeks.Let me cut it short for you, if you already have the S23 ultra, or S22 Ultra, there is absolutely no reason for you to upgrade to this one, both phones are almost identical despite all the YouTube videos that want you to think otherwise!The AI gimmick that's all over the internet isn't really integrated into everyday use as expected either so that was not a plus point.The battery quickly learned my patterns and got better after a few days of use,but still not enough for a full day.The processor is amazing and everything runs so smoothly all day long, from productivity apps to games, with its amazing screen, everything just looks better on this phone.But yeah still I am very pleased with my new beast even though only had it for a couple of weeks so far.Can't focus on anything properly and wide shots were all bent at the edges.S24U Review starts now (I got mine early from t-mobile with build ending in: AWM9)Pros1.
