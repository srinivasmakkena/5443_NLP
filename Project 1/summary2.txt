I highly recommend this seller!Product is literally like new not a single scratch, battery at 100% which Is essential to me considering the fact your paying for 1tb model in excellent condition.Easy transfer wireless set up apple 12  to 15.Although it's renewed but looks new.I cannot emphasize enough what a waste of time and money this iphone is.We got are new phones a day before estimated in an ice storm no less.Phone was as advertised in great condition.I recently just ordered this phone works great but came with the wrong charger port sent the old charger instead of new iPhone charger10 out of 10 works fine no bugs or delays, buttons works fine it looks great just like how you would get it from the Apple StoreEquipo en regular estado, cargador no funciona y cable en mal estadoExcelente estado del celular y la bateria
